            <p>
                This page presents a curated list of refactorings that have been underexplored in 
                real-world Java projects. These refactorings were identified through empirical 
                analysis and mining of open-source repositories, highlighting opportunities for 
                further research and tool support.

            <h2>Why These Refactorings Matter</h2>
            <p>
                By focusing on these underexplored refactorings, researchers and developers can 
                better understand patterns, tool support gaps, and potential improvements in 
                software quality and maintainability.
